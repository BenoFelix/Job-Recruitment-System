# Job-Recruitment-System
Mini Project For 6th semester

This project was done based on the College theme using the Flask framework and MySQL database.

There will be three actors in this project: Owner
                                            Admin
                                            User

The adminÂ has access to post jobs and approves or rejects applications.

The owner has all of the admin's access and additional access to create new owners or admin accounts and block unwanted users.

Users can search for jobs based on the departments they work in.

Each actor has a dashboard where they can view their information, make changes, or delete their account. Additionally, users can view their applications.
